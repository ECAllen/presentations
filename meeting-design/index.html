### Problem 

Some meetings are not collaborative  

\$$ cost\ of\ meeting = \sum each\  participant's\ salary \$$ 

#### AND 

Opportunity cost of not doing deep work
					</textarea>

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>

### Solution

To take a critical look at meetings that we are pulled into and use a methodical approach to improve them or accelerate ones that are already working. 

We can use methodologies from design disciplines to improve meeting experiences.

### The General Design Process  

(credited to Tim Brown)

1. Clearly define the problem throught observation and research.

2. Consider multiple options, as opposed to a single solution


					</textarea>
				</section>

### The General Design Process  

3. Select an option assumed to be the best and make a minimum viable concept/product. 

4. Execute and see how it performs in the real world with real people. Go to step 1 if needed.

### The Design Process Applied to Meetings

1. Identify the problem the meeting is inteaded to solve.

2. Revisit and experiment with format, including length of time and method of facilitation. (Consider skipping a few meetings to see what happens.)

### The Design Process Applied to Meetings

3. Make changes to the meeting permanent if they succeed. Eliminate changes that do not produce successes.

4. Walk away from meetings that no longer do the job intended.

### Identitfy the Problem

- What is the goal?

- Is it worth the collective salaries/opportunity costs to hold the meetings?

- Does a meeting solve the problem?


					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
### Identitfy the Problem

- Are there tools that coud replace the meeting? Salesforce, Asana, ICE, Slack etc...

- Does the problem require that much immediate communication?

- Critically evaluate each meeting to improve it.

### Run Experiments 

Brainstorm several ideas, then take the "best" idea and implement it. Accept that the best method might not be obvious which is why we do experiments.

#### Some ideas:

- manipulate sticky notes

- clock timer

- every person brings 3 ideas to the meeting


					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
- each person takes turns at the whiteboard

- take turns driving the agenda 

- continue/take long conversations/tangents offline/form working groups


					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
### Make changes and assess

Be open to changing format and experimenting. 

##### Signs changes are needed:

- Strong personalities drive a meeting and others are passive.

- Meeting is not longer collaborative (assuming that is the purpose).

- There is no longer debate.

### Design Constraints of all Meetings

### Better Meetings = Better Memories

Working memory =~ 30 seconds

Pacing is important to working memory to make the information more digestible


					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
### Better Meetings = Better Memories

Intermediate memory =~ 2 to 3 hours

The trick to making meetings actionable is to capture information in intermediate memory so that attendees can retain information after the meeting

People have difficulty absorbing information via listening after about 20 to 30 minutes

					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
### Consensus

3 people: 3 points of agreement

7 people: 21 points of agreement

Tackle this by breaking up into groups or invite less people


					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
### Scale ideas to time

People can only remember about 7 concepts over about 10 minutes (backed up by research)

Stop and review every 10 minutes then move forward
