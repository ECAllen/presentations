### Solution

To take a critical look at meetings that we are pulled into and use a methodical approach to improve them or accelerate ones that are already working. 

We can use methodologies from design disciplines to improve meeting experiences.

### The General Design Process  

(credited to Tim Brown)

1. Clearly define the problem throught observation and research.

2. Consider multiple options, as opposed to a single solution

3. Select an option assumed to be the best and make a minimum viable concept/product. 

4. Execute and see how it performs in the real world with real people. Go to step 1 if needed.

### The Design Process Applied to Meetings

1. Identify the problem the meeting is inteaded to solve.

2. Revisit and experimant with format, including length of time and method of facilitation. (Consider skipping a few meetings to see what happens)

### The Design Process Applied to Meetings

3. Make changes to the meeting permanent if they succeed. Eliminate changes that do not produce successes.

4. Walk awasy from meetings that no longer do the job intended.

### Identitfy the Problem

- What is the goal?

- Is is worth the collective salaries/opportunity costs to hold the meetings?

- Does a meeting solve the problem?

- Are there tools that coud replace the meeting? Salesforce, Asana, ICE, Slack etc...

- Fast vs. Slow does the problem require that much immediate communication?

- Critically evaluate each meeting to improve it.

### Run Experiments 

Brainstorm several ideas...  then take the "best" idea and implement it. Accept that the best method might not be obvious which is why we do experiments.

#### Some ideas:

- manipulate sticky notes

- clock timer

- every person brings 3 ideas to the meeting

- each person takes turns at the whiteboard

- take turns driving the agenda 

- continue/take long conversations/tangents offline/form working groups

### Make changes and assess

- Be open to changing format and experimenting. 

- Signs changes are needed:

- Strong personalities drive a meeting and others are passive.

- Meeting is not longer collaborative (assuming that is the purpose).

- Everyone is in autopilot.

- There is not longer debate.
